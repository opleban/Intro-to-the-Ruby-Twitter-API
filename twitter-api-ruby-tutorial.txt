# Getting started with the Twitter API using Ruby

## A simple tutorial, providing code and context.

### Some assumptions

* Ruby is installed and functionnal
* You are connected to the network
* You can follow simple instructions ;-)

### Getting started

First thing you need to do: install the Twitter Ruby Gem.

You can find it at http://twitter.rubyforge.org/

Then open your terminal and type:

    gem install twitter

If everything works fine (why shouldn't it?) you will get a welcome message after fetching the gem is done. The latest version of this gem at the time of writing was twitter-2.1.0.gem.

We will now create a simple file to get started. Create a file called twitter.rb with the two following lines:

```ruby
require 'twitter'
puts Twitter.status(167309659198328832).text 
 ```
Save it (duh). When you excute twitter.rb, you will get the tweet with ID "167309659198328832" in your terminal output. It's a message from @twitterapi, check http://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/167309659198328832 to compare both.







### Notes

Tested with Ruby 1.9.3p0 on OSX 10.7
